<center> <font color="white" size="7" </font> what is artificial intelligence (AI)   </center> 
<h5> <font color="black" size="4"> In the simplest terms, artificial intelligence (AI) refers to systems or devices that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and that can improve themselves based on the information they gather. Artificial intelligence manifests itself in a number of forms. Some of these examples:
<br>
•	Chatbots use artificial intelligence to understand customer problems faster and provide more efficient answers
<br>
•	AI uses it to analyze critical information from a large set of text data to improve scheduling
<br>
•	Recommendation engines can provide automated recommendations for TV shows based on users' viewing habits
<br> <br>

AI is more about the ability to think and analyze data than it is about a particular form or function. Although AI presents images of high-performance human-like robots taking over the world, it is not intended to replace humans. It aims to significantly enhance human capabilities and contributions. This makes it a very valuable business asset.</font> </h5>
