<font color="black" size="4"> <h4> <ul> 
<l1>Three factors are driving the development of AI across industries:</h4> </l1>
<br>
 
 <h4> It provides easy and affordable high-performance computing.</h4> The abundance of business computing power in the cloud has enabled easy access to affordable high-performance computing. Prior to this development, the only computing environments available for AI were not cloud-based and cost prohibitive.
<br>


  <h4> <l2>Having large amounts of data available for learning.</h4> </l2> AI needs to learn from a lot of data to make correct predictions. The emergence of various tools for collecting disaggregated data, in addition to the ability for organizations to easily and affordably store and process this data, both structural and unstructured data, has led to more organizations being able to create and train AI algorithms.
<br>

 <h4> <l3> Applied AI technology provides a competitive advantage.</h4> </l3> Companies are increasingly realizing the competitive advantage of applying AI insights to business goals and making them a business-wide priority. For example, targeted recommendations provided by AI technology can help make better decisions faster. The many features and capabilities of AI can reduce costs, reduce risks, speed up time to market, and much more. </font>
