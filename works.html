<h3> <font color="black" size="5"> An AI engineer builds AI models using machine learning algorithms and deep learning neural networks to draw business insights, which can be used to make business decisions that affect the entire organization. These engineers also create weak or strong AIs, depending on what goals they want to achieve. 
<br> <br>
AI engineers have a sound understanding of programming, software engineering, and data science. They use different tools and techniques so they can process data, as well as develop and maintain AI systems.
<br> <br>
The next section of How to become an AI Engineer focuses on the responsibilities of an AI engineer.</font> </h3>
