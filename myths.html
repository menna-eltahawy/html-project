<center> <font color="white" size="7" </font> 5 common myths about enterprise AI   </center> 
<br>

<font color="black" size="4"> While many companies have successfully embraced AI technology, there is a lot of misinformation about AI and what it can and cannot do. Here are five common myths about artificial intelligence:
<br>

	<h4>Myth 1: AI requires a DIY approach.</h4>
Fact: Most companies embrace AI by combining both in-house and unconventional solutions. Developing in-house AI allows companies to customize unique business needs; Pre-built AI solutions enable you to simplify implementation with a ready-to-use solution to the most common business problems.
        <br>
	<h4>Myth 2: AI delivers magical results instantly.</h4>
Fact: The road to AI success takes time, thoughtful planning, and a clear idea of the results  you want to achieve. You need a strategic framework and an iterative approach to avoid introducing a random set of disconnected AI solutions
	<br>.
	<h4>Myth 3: AI does not require people to operate it.</h4>
Fact: AI is not about bots controlling it. The value of AI is that it increases human capabilities and reduces the burden on your employees to devote themselves to more strategic tasks. Moreover, AI relies on people to provide it with the right data and work with it in the right way.
        <br>  
	<h4>Myth 4: The more data, the better.</h4>
Fact: Enterprise AI needs smart data. To get the most effective business insights from AI, your data needs to be high-quality, up-to-date, relevant, and rich.
        <br>
	<h4>Myth 5: Enterprise AI only needs data and models to succeed.</h4>
Fact: Data, algorithms, and models are the starting point. But the AI solution must be scalable to meet changing business needs. So far, most enterprise AI solutions have been designed by data scientists. These solutions require extensive manual setup and maintenance and are not scalable. To successfully implement AI projects, you need AI solutions that are scalable to meet the needs as you move forward with AI technology </font>
